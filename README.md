## ✨ A Revolutionary Visual Experience

Transform your Minecraft world with **Surface-Stable Fractal Dithering** — a groundbreaking rendering technique where dither dots **stick to 3D surfaces** instead of the screen, creating a unique manga/comic book aesthetic that feels alive.

## 🖼️ What Makes This Shader Special?

### 📌 **Surface-Stable Dots**
Unlike traditional dithering where patterns "swim" on screen, Dither3D anchors each dot to the actual 3D surface. Walk around blocks, and the dots stay perfectly attached!

### 🔄 **Fractal Scaling Magic**
As you move closer or farther from surfaces, dots dynamically split or merge to maintain **constant screen-space density**. It's mesmerizing to watch!

### 🎨 **Three Color Modes**

| Mode | Description |
|:----:|:------------|
| **Grayscale** | Classic black & white dithering — clean, minimalist, timeless |
| **RGB** | Each color channel gets its own dot layer — vibrant and unique |
| **CMYK Halftone** | Authentic newspaper/comic print simulation with rotated dot angles |

## ⚡ Features at a Glance

| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| 🎯 **Precision Dithering** | SVD-based frequency analysis for mathematically perfect dot placement |
| 🌀 **Anti-Stretch Technology** | Anisotropic smoothing keeps dots circular even on oblique surfaces |
| 🎥 **Camera Stable** | Radial compensation prevents dot swimming during camera rotation |
| ⚙️ **Highly Configurable** | 10+ parameters to fine-tune your perfect look |
| 🚀 **Performance Optimized** | Efficient 3D texture sampling for smooth gameplay |
| 📱 **Universal Compatibility** | Works with OptiFine AND Iris on virtually any Minecraft version |

## 🎛️ Customization Options

Fine-tune every aspect of the dithering effect with our intuitive in-game sliders:

### 🔧 Dither Settings
| Parameter | Range | Effect |
|-----------|:-----:|--------|
| **Dot Scale** | 2 - 10 | Control overall dot size (exponential) |
| **Size Variability** | 0 - 1 | 0 = Bayer pattern, 1 = Halftone style |
| **Dot Contrast** | 0 - 2 | Sharpen or soften dot edges |
| **Stretch Smooth** | 0 - 2 | Combat stretched dots on angled surfaces |

### 💡 Input Controls
| Parameter | Range | Effect |
|-----------|:-----:|--------|
| **Exposure** | 0 - 5 | Brightness multiplier |
| **Offset** | -1 to 1 | Brightness offset adjustment |

### 🎮 Additional Options
- **Inverse Dots** — Flip dot colors for a negative effect
- **Radial Compensation** — Stabilize during camera rotation *(recommended!)*
- **Quantize Layers** — Prevent dot morphing for a more "classic" look
- **Debug Mode** — Visualize fractal layers for development

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this work with other shaders?**
> Dithering3D is a standalone shader pack. Combining with other shaders may cause conflicts.

**Q: Why do some surfaces look different?**
> The sky and some special effects may appear different as surface-stable dithering reveals flat geometry.

**Q: Performance impact?**
> Moderate. The 3D texture sampling is optimized but more demanding than vanilla rendering. Most GPUs handle it smoothly.

**Q: Can I use this in my modpack?**
> Yes! Under MPL-2.0 license. Credit appreciated.

## 🔬 The Science Behind It

Dithering3D uses **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to analyze UV coordinate derivatives in real-time, determining the exact frequency and direction of surface textures. This mathematical approach enables:

```
✅ Perfectly uniform dot density regardless of distance
✅ Seamless fractal transitions between detail levels  
✅ Circular dots even on extremely angled surfaces
✅ Rotation-stable patterns that don't "swim"
```
